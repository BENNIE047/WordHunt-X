## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### File Type Filtering

By default, WordHunt-X searches these file types for maximum speed:
- `.txt` - Text files
- `.sh` - Shell scripts
- `.log` - Log files
- `.conf` - Configuration files
- `.md` - Markdown documentation

**Want to search ALL files?** Edit line 85 in the script and switch to comprehensive mode (slower but complete).

### Parallel Processing

WordHunt-X uses `xargs -P 4` to search 4 files simultaneously. 

**Optimize for your system:**
```bash
# Check your CPU cores
nproc

# Edit script to match (e.g., 8 cores)
xargs -P 8 grep -l ...
```

### Interactive Preview

After finding results, you can:
1. View the contents of any file
2. See highlighted matches with line numbers
3. Get context around each match

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as WordHunt-X
    participant F as Find
    participant X as Xargs
    participant G as Grep
    
    U->>W: Enter search word
    W->>F: Locate text files
    F->>X: Send file list
    X->>G: Parallel search (4 cores)
    G->>W: Return matches
    W->>U: Display results ⚡
    
    Note over X,G: 4x faster with parallel processing!
```

</div>

### The Technology Stack

<div align="center">

| Tool | Purpose | Why It's Fast |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **`find`** | Locates files | Pre-filters by file type |
| **`xargs`** | Parallel processing | Uses all CPU cores |
| **`grep`** | Text searching | Optimized pattern matching |
| **Bash** | Orchestration | Efficient scripting |

</div>

### The Process

```
Input → Validation → File Discovery → Parallel Search → Result Aggregation → Display
```

### Speed Optimizations

<div align="center">

| Technique | Speed Gain | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 🔀 Parallel processing | **4x** | `xargs -P 4` |
| 🎯 File type filtering | **2-3x** | `find` with `-name` patterns |
| 🚫 Binary file skipping | **1.5x** | Text file focus |
| 🔇 Error suppression | **1.2x** | `2>/dev/null` |

**Combined effect: Up to 14x faster than basic grep!** 🚀

</div>

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **OS:** Linux, macOS, or Unix-like system
- **Shell:** Bash 4.0 or higher
- **Tools:** `find`, `grep`, `xargs` (pre-installed on most systems)
- **Permissions:** Read access to search directories
- **Recommended:** Multi-core CPU for parallel processing benefits

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Permission Handling

WordHunt-X automatically suppresses permission errors for cleaner output:
```bash
2>/dev/null  # Hides "Permission denied" messages
```

For root/system directories, consider:
```bash
sudo ./wordfinder.sh  # Run with elevated permissions
```

### System-Wide Searches

Searching the entire system (`/`) can:
- Take several minutes even with optimizations
- Generate many results
- Require significant CPU resources

**Recommendation:** Start with your home folder or specific directories.

### Large Result Sets

If you find 100+ files, consider:
- Refining your search term
- Narrowing the search directory
- Using case-sensitive mode for precision

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No matches found" but you know it exists

**Solution 1:** Try case-insensitive search
```
🔤 Case-sensitive search? (y/n): n
```

**Solution 2:** Check file permissions
```bash
ls -l /path/to/file
# If you can't read it, WordHunt-X can't either
```

### Search is slow

**Solution 1:** Reduce search scope
```
Choose a specific directory instead of entire system
```

**Solution 2:** Increase parallel processes
```bash
# Edit script: change -P 4 to -P 8 (or your CPU core count)
xargs -P 8 grep -l ...
```

### Script won't run

**Solution:** Check execution permissions
```bash
chmod +x wordfinder.sh
./wordfinder.sh
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change File Types

Edit line 85 to search different file types:
```bash
# Add Python files
find "$DIR" -type f \( -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.py" \)
```

### Modify Search Algorithm

Want different grep options? Edit line 86:
```bash
# Add context lines around matches
grep -l -C 2 $CASE_FLAG "$WORD"

# Search for whole words only
grep -l -w $CASE_FLAG "$WORD"
```

### Adjust Spinner Speed

Change the progress indicator speed (line 93):
```bash
sleep 0.1  # Change to 0.05 for faster, 0.2 for slower
```

## 💬 FAQ

**Q: Can I search for multiple words at once?**  
A: Currently searches one word per run. Run multiple times or search for phrases: "word1 word2"

**Q: Does it work on external drives?**  
A: Yes! Enter the mount point as custom directory (e.g., `/mnt/usb/`)

**Q: Can I stop a search in progress?**  
A: Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel. Temp files are automatically cleaned up.

**Q: Will this work on Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Absolutely! Though parallel processing benefits are limited on single-core models.

**Q: Can I use wildcards in search terms?**  
A: Basic wildcards work. For advanced patterns, edit the grep command to use `-E` (regex).

**Q: Does it search hidden files?**  
A: Yes! Hidden files (starting with `.`) are included automatically.

**Q: What about compressed files (.zip, .tar.gz)?**  
A: Not by default. Decompress first, then search.
